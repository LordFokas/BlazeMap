/**
 * A GhostLayer is an invisible layer that does not render in the map, for when you need a layer but you don't want a layer.
 * GhostLayers are treated exactly the same way in every situation, with these differences:
 * - They do not generate a tile, nor does the engine ask them to.
 * - They are never considered opaque. This means they must have an icon as they are not expected to be the bottom layer of any map.
 *
 * In practical terms, what this means is that you can use GhostLayers to put markers on the map.
 * Using multiple ghost layers enables you to segregate markers, and disabling the layers on the side panel will hide only
 * this set of markers.
